Infoviz Sketches
==================================


by Scott Kildall


## Hello and Who I am
My name is [Scott Kildall](www.kildall.com) and I'm a new media artist and educator. 

These are some sample Processing sketches I use for teaching Information Visualization using Processing.


## Getting Started
These are some quick getting-to-know Processing samples, which I've adapted from from "Getting Started in Processing" book by Casey Raes and Ben Fry. I've also included quick a bit of my own sketch samples here.

The goal here is to show how to draw shapes and ultimately how to export as a PDF, which is what we will want to use for Illustator ouput (export to PDF)

### Mouse_Shape
Good starter sketch for understanding how to draw shapes

### Simple_Draw
Drawing shapes using functions, shows a for loop

### Simple_Draw_Lines
Builds on Simple_Draw, but adds lines to it, look at order of drawing

### Simple_Draw_Alpha
Builds on Simple_Draw but uses ellipses and shows you how an alpha channel might be output

### Simple_Draw_Alpha_PDF
Same as Simple_Draw_Alpha, but Outputs to PDF with spacebar

### Simple_Draw_Lines_PDF
Builds on Simple_Draw_Lines to output a PDF when you press the space bar.
